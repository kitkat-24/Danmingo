Project Summary
===============
Danmingo is a fun little project meant to be able to sample flexible datasets of
English text and provide some analysis on common letters and clusters. The end
goal is to add in some webscraping abilities to draw from freely available books
or other texts and social media data to get a broader range of real-world use
cases. This data is ultimately meant to be used for creating some new "letters"
to allow more efficient writing of the English language, mainly because I write
notes in runes sometimes. I'm also gonna use the data to come up with
essentially a Huffman-encoding of the English language, to make a script that
theoretically allows for the fastest possible handwriting.


Usage

This is going to be changing frequently for now since the project is just
starting out.
