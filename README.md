Project Summary
===============
Danmingo is a fun little project meant to be able to sample flexible datasets of
English text and provide some analysis on common letters and clusters. The end
goal is to add in some webscraping abilities to draw from freely available books
or other texts and social media data to get a broader range of real-world use
cases. This data is ultimately meant to be used for creating some new "letters"
to allow more efficient writing of the English language, mainly because I write
notes in runes sometimes. I'm also gonna use the data to come up with
essentially a Huffman-encoding of the English language, to make a script that
theoretically allows for the fastest possible handwriting.


Usage
=====
For now, the usage is just running `danmingo.py` in Python 3. You can tweak the
main to run whatever you want, and you'll have to change the system dictionary
string if you're not on MacOS (well, it'll probably work on Linux too).


Plans
=====
My next step is probably adding some graphics that display the results a little
more clearly, and maybe a basic GUI. 

Comparing the results between different data sets would be good too.

Finally, building a scraper to run on Twitter/Facebook so we can compare
dictionary and literature to modern speech on social media.
